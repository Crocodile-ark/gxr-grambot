## üöß Bot Development Status

The GXR Telegram farming bot is currently in its final development phase, with core functionality already implemented and undergoing internal testing.

We aim to launch the bot between **October and November 2025**, depending on infrastructure readiness and testing stability. The bot is designed to support Telegram-based farming, airdrops, and referral systems, optimized for mobile use and seamless wallet integration.

However, without initial funding to support key infrastructure (such as hardware and network access), the public release may experience a slight delay ‚Äî potentially shifting the launch window to **December 2025 or January 2026**.
